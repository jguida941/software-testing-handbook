# Software Testing Assignment - Dependency Vulnerability Analysis

## Testing Performed

### Static Testing (Python Module)
**Tools Used:**
- Pylint (version check: `pylint --version`)
- Mypy for type checking

**Commands Run:** (from the repository root `software-testing/`)
```bash
cd python/
pylint static_analysis_example.py
mypy static_analysis_example.py
```

**Results:** Found approximately 15 code quality issues including missing docstrings, naming convention violations, and type hint warnings.

### Dynamic Security Testing (Java Module 2.1)
**Tool Used:** OWASP Dependency-Check version 11.0.0

**Exact Command Run:** (from the repository root `software-testing/`)
```bash
cd java/Module2.1/
./mvnw clean compile dependency-check:check -DskipTests
```

**Report Generated:**
- HTML Report: `target/dependency-check-report.html` (2.4MB)
- JSON Report: `target/dependency-check-report.json` (1.6MB)

## Vulnerability Findings

The OWASP Dependency-Check scan identified:
- **Total Vulnerabilities:** 162
- **Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0):** 21 vulnerabilities
- **High (CVSS 7.0-8.9):** 69 vulnerabilities
- **Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9):** 69 vulnerabilities
- **Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9):** 3 vulnerabilities

### Most Critical Issues Found

1. **CVE-2022-22965 (Spring4Shell)** - CVSS Score: 9.8
   - Affected: spring-core-5.2.3.RELEASE.jar, spring-web-5.2.3.RELEASE.jar
   - Risk: Remote code execution through data binding

2. **CVE-2022-1471 (SnakeYAML)** - CVSS Score: 9.8
   - Affected: snakeyaml-1.25.jar
   - Risk: Unsafe deserialization allows arbitrary code execution

3. **CVE-2020-1938 (Ghostcat)** - CVSS Score: 9.8
   - Affected: tomcat-embed-core-9.0.30.jar
   - Risk: File read vulnerability and potential RCE via AJP

4. **CVE-2017-8046** - CVSS Score: 9.8
   - Affected: spring-data-rest-webmvc-2.6.5.RELEASE.jar
   - Risk: Malicious PATCH requests can execute arbitrary code

## Recommended Solutions

### Primary Fix
Update Spring Boot parent version in pom.xml:
```xml
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>2.7.18</version>  <!-- Updated from 2.2.4 -->
</parent>
```

This single change will:
- Update Spring Framework from 5.2.3 to 5.3.31 (fixes Spring4Shell)
- Update Tomcat from 9.0.30 to 9.0.83 (fixes Ghostcat)
- Update multiple other vulnerable dependencies

### Additional Required Fix
Update SnakeYAML explicitly:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.yaml</groupId>
    <artifactId>snakeyaml</artifactId>
    <version>2.2</version>  <!-- Updated from 1.25 -->
</dependency>
```

## Why This Testing Matters

1. **Static Testing** caught code quality issues early (cheaper to fix)
2. **Dynamic Testing** found actual security vulnerabilities in dependencies
3. Together they provide comprehensive coverage - static testing wouldn't find the dependency vulnerabilities, and dynamic testing wouldn't catch code style issues

## Business Impact if Not Fixed

- These vulnerabilities are actively exploited in the wild
- Spring4Shell has public exploit code available
- Could lead to complete server compromise
- Potential for data breaches and compliance violations (PCI-DSS, GDPR)
- Average data breach cost: $4.45 million (IBM 2023 report)

## Conclusion

The scan revealed serious security risks requiring immediate attention. Upgrading Spring Boot from 2.2.4 to 2.7.18 and SnakeYAML to 2.2 will resolve the critical vulnerabilities. This demonstrates why both static and dynamic testing are essential - they find different types of problems that together ensure software quality and security.
