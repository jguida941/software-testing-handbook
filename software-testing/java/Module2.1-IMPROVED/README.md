# Module2.1-IMPROVED Placeholder

The secure implementation of Module2.1 lives **only** on the `secure-version` branch.

```bash
# Switch branches before attempting to build the improved module
git checkout secure-version
cd software-testing/java/Module2.1-IMPROVED
```

This placeholder exists on `master` to remind readers where to find the code and to avoid the previous "empty directory" confusion.
